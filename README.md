# WhisperAds

Chrome extension that automatically mutes or reduces volume during Twitch ads.

## Features

- Detects when Twitch plays ads
- Auto-mutes or lowers the volume during ads
- Simple toggle to enable/disable behavior (refresh once change is made)
- Remembers your setting using Chrome sync storage

## Usage

- Click the extension icon to open the popup.
- Use the toggle switch to turn the feature on or off.
- Setting is saved and applied automatically to Twitch tabs.

## Tech Stack

- JavaScript (vanilla)
- Manifest V3 (Chrome Extensions API)
- HTML & CSS (with animated gradient and subtle grid background)

## Status

ðŸš§ This is currently available on the Chrome Web Store.  I am currently
reworking the UI so that it's a bit easier to use.  I also am working on 
fixing a couple niche bugs to enhance user experience.  The extension
in its current state works very reliably, and I recommend for now using the
'mute' setting.
